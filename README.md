# Internet-Speed-Test-Using-Web-Scraping
This is a web scraping script which is used to test check internet speed without the hassle of going to the browser.


This is simple web-scraping script based on Node.js and Puppetter. In order to use this on daily basis it is not possible to run the script manually each time to check the internet speed, thus a .bat is created which when executed will automatically run the web-scripting script.


Tip: Create a Shortcut of the .bat file and paste it onto the desktop, then you will have easy access to the script without changing any directory.
